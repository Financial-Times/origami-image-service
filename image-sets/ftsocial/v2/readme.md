## Usage

As with all image sets, these are available via the [Image Service](https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2).

To get an social logo from the Image Service, use the following URL (replace the `product_source` with your product name and `icon_name` with the icon you want)

`https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftsocial:{icon_name}?source={product_source}`

So to get a twitter icon:
`https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftsocial:twitter?source=test`


### Getting these icons in a different colour/format/size

The Image Service will convert these images on the fly if you pass in the right parameters. To find out more about this, please see the [Image Service documentation](https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/docs/api)

## Adding or modifying icons

To keep social icons consistent, please follow these guidelines:

- Icons must be SVG format
- Icons must represent the brand colours of the social network
- Icons should have a viewBox of 1024x1024
- Icons must be passed through an SVG compressor like SVGOMG
- File names must be all lower case and hyphenated
  - **good** twitter.svg, financial-times.svg, yahoo.svg
  - **bad** Twitter.svg, financialtimes.svdg, yahoo!.svg

## Removing an image

Please [raise an issue](http://github.com/financial-times/origami/issues) so that the Origami team can manage the deprecation process.
