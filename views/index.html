<h1>
	Optimise and resize images.<br/>
	The right and easy way.
</h1>

<p>
	The Origami Image Service can be used to optimise and resize images.
	You can crop, tint, and convert images in JPEG, PNG, GIF and SVG formats quickly and easily.
</p>

<p>
	The quickest way to get started is to experiment with the <a href="{{@root.basePath}}v2/docs/url-builder">URL builder</a>, and try
	transforming and optimising some of your images.
	Read the <a href="{{@root.basePath}}v2/docs/api">API documentation</a> for more information on all of the available transforms.
	If you're migrating from Image Service v1, we maintain a <a href="{{@root.basePath}}v2/docs/migration">migration guide</a> to help you.
